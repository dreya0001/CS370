Pirate Intelligent Agent: Reinforcement Learning Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on the application of reinforcement learning and neural networks to create a pirate intelligent agent capable of navigating a treasure hunt environment. The agent was developed using deep Q-learning techniques, and the project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the practical application of reinforcement learning principles in solving a complex, real-world problem.

Work Summary
Provided Code: The project began with a partially developed framework that included the environment setup, basic functions for state representation, and some utility methods for visualizing the agent's progress.
Created Code: I implemented the Q-learning algorithm, designed the neural network architecture for the agent's decision-making process, and trained the agent using the reward feedback system. Additionally, I added visualization tools to track the agent's learning progress and debugged issues related to convergence and performance.
Reflection on Learning
Connecting Course Concepts to Computer Science
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and develop algorithms, systems, and software to solve real-world problems. They apply theoretical principles to create innovative solutions, such as improving healthcare, automating processes, or enhancing user experiences in digital products. This work is crucial as it drives technological advancement, making systems more efficient and accessible to society.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically by:

Defining the problem clearly and identifying constraints.
Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components.
Researching and selecting appropriate tools, techniques, or algorithms.
Iteratively developing, testing, and refining the solution.
Evaluating the performance and ensuring it meets the defined goals.
For this project, I applied this approach by:

Understanding the treasure hunt environment and its challenges.
Identifying reinforcement learning as the best strategy to solve the problem.
Implementing and testing the agent's learning process iteratively.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include:

Fairness: Ensuring that algorithms are unbiased and inclusive.
Privacy: Protecting user data and preventing misuse of sensitive information.
Transparency: Providing clear explanations of how systems work and their potential limitations.
Safety: Avoiding harm by thoroughly testing systems to prevent unintended consequences.
In the context of this project, ethical considerations include ensuring that the reinforcement learning agent behaves predictably and that its decision-making processes are transparent for real-world applications.
